# Razor Blade Tutorial App

This is a 2sxc app to quickly learn/discover what _[Razor Blade](https://github.com/DNN-Connect/razor-blade)_ can do for you and see the various syntax examples.

You can simply browse the code, or install it on a [DNN](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/) with [2sxc](https://2sxc.org/) to play around with it. We recommend that you run it inside DNN.

If you don't have a DNN with 2sxc installed yet, the fastest way to do that is to...

1. Download the helper tool [nvQuickSite](https://www.nvquicksite.com/) whith is the best way to quickly get a DNN running on your local PC.
1. Then using install wizard in nvQuickSite, install the latest DNN.
1. Install _[Razor Blade](https://github.com/DNN-Connect/razor-blade)_ in DNN
1. Once you have DNN running, get the latest [2sxc release](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) and install 2sxc
1. Add a 2sxc App-module to the page, and in the resulting wizard, install this app from the [releases](https://github.com/DNN-Connect/razor-blade/releases)
